<h2>Othello</h2>

<h3>The rules of othello</h3>

<p>Othello is a game for two players, played on an 8 by 8 square grid,
using pieces which are black on one side and white on the other. The
game begins by placing four counters in the centre of the board, two
showing black and two showing white.

<p>Black plays first, and the players take turns to place one counter
on the board. Each move must trap at least one of your opponent's
pieces between the piece you just put down, and one of your pieces
already on the board.  You can trap pieces in any direction; up, down,
sideways or diagonal.  The trapped pieces are turned over so they now
show your colour. 

<p>You must move if you are able to do so, but if you
cannot trap any pieces then you lose your turn.  If neither player can
move, or when the board is full, the game ends.  The player with the
most pieces of their colour showing on the board at the end of the
game is the winner.

<h3>Program help</h3>

<p>The program can play either side, or both if you're feeling lazy,
or neither if you want to play against another person.  This is
controlled from the <b>Options</b> menu. You can also choose whether
to display the legal moves available to each player.  

<p>The <b>Game</b> menu starts a new game or quits the program.

<p>The <b>Level</b> menu adjusts the level of computer play; the level number
is the number of half-moves the program looks ahead. (A single
player's move is a half-move; the opponent's reply makes it a whole
move).  You can also choose whether to use <em>endgame solving</em>;
this allows the computer to look all the way ahead to the end of the
game when there are a certain number of moves left, enabling it to
play perfectly from that point on.  

<p>The <b>Help</b> menu just displays this help file.
